# Machine Learning Project Report

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

The hospitality industry has undergone a significant transformation with the advent of online hotel reservation channels. These platforms have revolutionized the way hotel bookings are made and have led to changes in customer behavior. As a result, hotels have had to adapt their strategies to accommodate these new booking trends.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

One of the challenges faced by hotels is the high number of reservation cancellations or no-shows. There are various reasons why guests cancel their reservations, such as changes in plans or conflicting schedules. To attract customers, many hotels offer flexible cancellation policies, allowing guests to cancel free of charge or at a low cost. While this benefits the guests, it can pose revenue challenges for hotels.

### 1.3 Objective

The objective of this analysis is to explore a dataset called "Hotel Reservation.csv" and leverage machine learning classification models to gain insights into reservation cancellations. By understanding the factors that contribute to cancellations, hotels can make informed decisions to optimize their revenue and operational strategies.

### 1.4 Data Overview

The "Hotel Reservation.csv" dataset contains 36275 rows and 19 columns. Each row represents a hotel reservation, and the columns provide information about the reservation details, guest demographics, and booking attributes. The dataset will serve as the foundation for our analysis and machine learning modeling.

## 2. Problem Definition and Algorithm

### 2.1 Task Definition

Precisely define the problem you are addressing (i.e. formally specify the inputs and outputs). Elaborate on why this is an interesting and important problem.

### 2.2 Algorithm Definition

Describe in reasonable detail the algorithm you are using to address this problem. A psuedocode description of the algorithm you are using is frequently useful. Trace through a concrete example, showing how your algorithm processes this example. The example should be complex enough to illustrate all of the important aspects of the problem but simple enough to be easily understood. If possible, an intuitively meaningful example is better than one with meaningless symbols.

## 3. Experimental Evaluation

### 3.1 Methodology

What are criteria you are using to evaluate your method? What specific hypotheses does your experiment test? Describe the experimental methodology that you used. What are the dependent and independent variables? What is the training/test data that was used, and why is it realistic or interesting? Exactly what performance data did you collect and how are you presenting and analyzing it? Comparisons to competing methods that address the same problem are particularly useful.

### 3.2 Results

Present the quantitative results of your experiments. Graphical data presentation such as graphs and histograms are frequently better than tables. What are the basic differences revealed in the data. Are they statistically significant?

### 3.3 Discussion

Is your hypothesis supported? What conclusions do the results support about the strengths and weaknesses of your method compared to other methods? How can the results be explained in terms of the underlying properties of the algorithm and/or the data.

## 4. Related Work

Answer the following questions for each piece of related work that addresses the same or a similar problem. What is their problem and method? How is your problem and method different? Why is your problem and method better?

## 5. Future Work

What are the major shortcomings of your current method? For each shortcoming, propose additions or enhancements that would help overcome it.

## 6. Conclusion
Briefly summarize the important results and conclusions presented in the paper. What are the most important points illustrated by your work? How will your results improve future research and applications in the area?
